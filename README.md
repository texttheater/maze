Maze is a browser game in which you move a pawn through a maze in order to
reach the target. The catch is that the maze has multiple floors and you only
ever see one at a time â€“ a challenge to your memory and spatial thinking.

Maze was developed for fun by [Kilian Evang](http://kilian.evang.name/) and
owes much to the great blog posts and book on mazes by Jamis Buck, who also
made [Mazoo](http://mazoo.jamisbuck.org/). Check it out!
